# UniFi Access MCP Server

You have access to a UniFi Access MCP server that lets you query and manage a UniFi Access controller. It provides 34 tools covering doors, locks, credentials, visitors, access policies, events, devices, and system health.

## Tool Discovery

The server uses **lazy loading** by default — only meta-tools are registered initially:

| Meta-Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `access_tool_index` | Discover tools by name/description; use `category`, `search`, or `include_schemas` to filter |
| `access_execute` | Call any tool by name (essential in lazy mode) |
| `access_batch` | Run multiple tools in parallel |
| `access_batch_status` | Check async batch job status |

**Workflow:** Call `access_tool_index` to find the right tool, then `access_execute` to call it. Use `access_batch` for multiple independent queries.

## Safety Model

**All mutations are disabled by default** because Access controls physical door locks and building entry.

**Read operations** — always available. Listing doors, events, users, credentials — all work without permissions.

**Mutations** require explicit opt-in via env vars:
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_DOORS_UPDATE=true` — lock/unlock doors
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_CREDENTIALS_CREATE=true` — create NFC/PIN/mobile credentials
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_CREDENTIALS_DELETE=true` — revoke credentials
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_VISITORS_CREATE=true` — create visitor passes
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_VISITORS_DELETE=true` — delete visitor passes
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_POLICIES_UPDATE=true` — update access policies
- `UNIFI_POLICY_ACCESS_DEVICES_UPDATE=true` — reboot devices

**Confirmation flow** — every mutation uses preview-then-confirm:
1. Default call → returns preview of what would change
2. Call with `confirm=true` → executes the mutation

Door lock/unlock operations are **physical real-world actions** — always preview first.

## Response Format

All tools return: `{"success": true, "data": ...}`, `{"success": false, "error": "..."}`, or `{"success": true, "requires_confirmation": true, "preview": ...}`. Always check `success` first.

## Key Capabilities

- **Door control:** `access_lock_door` / `access_unlock_door` — unlock relocks automatically after duration (default 2 seconds)
- **Real-time events:** `access_recent_events` reads from websocket buffer instantly. Event types: `door_open`, `door_close`, `access_granted`, `access_denied`, `door_alarm`
- **Historical events:** `access_list_events` with time/door/user filters. Topics: `admin` or `admin_activity`
- **Activity summary:** `access_get_activity_summary` aggregates events over a time period — useful for security audits
- **Credentials:** Create NFC (`{user_id, token}`), PIN (`{user_id, pin_code}`), or mobile (`{user_id}`) credentials
- **Visitor passes:** Time-bounded with ISO 8601 start/end times, optional email/phone for notifications

## Dual Authentication

Access has two independent auth paths:

- **API key (port 12445)** — for read-only operations (listing doors, events, devices)
- **Username + password (port 443)** — required for mutations (lock/unlock, credentials, visitors)

Either can work independently. For full functionality, configure both. If mutations fail with auth errors, the user needs username+password (API key alone is not enough for write operations).

To configure, run `/unifi-access:unifi-access-setup` or set env vars manually:
```
UNIFI_ACCESS_HOST=192.168.1.1
UNIFI_ACCESS_API_KEY=your-api-key
UNIFI_ACCESS_USERNAME=admin
UNIFI_ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Other UniFi Servers

If the user also has networking or cameras, other UniFi MCP plugins are available:
- `unifi-network` — network devices, clients, firewall, VPN, routing
- `unifi-protect` — security cameras, NVR, recordings, smart detections

Access readers are network clients — if a reader appears offline, the Network server can help check connectivity via `unifi_lookup_by_ip`.
